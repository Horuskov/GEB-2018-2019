# GEB-2018-2019 website development

UPDATE: there are ideas for the future of the website;
- a complete overhaul of the website. There must be tons of lines of code to delete, change, ... Considering our poor knowledge on designing a website ready to be surfed on the Internet, it's normal. Moreover, the code is not well-structured, css code is 600 lines... doesn't make it clear what do what.
- make the website responsive for tablet and mobile. For example the header bar menu content overlap with itself when screen is squezed to fit mobile screen dimensions.
- update the home page
- create content for about GEB, Alumni such as: photo gallery, companies of students, ...


GEB website made by GEb students for GEB students (Lille - France)
Hello all! This is the website for GEB students!

Find out what we coded as our first website as part of the M2 GEB projects involving 3 students. We are fresh apprentice in web development and the project was a way of increasing our skills.

Thanks for joining us ;-)

PS: the website is temporarily put aside as GEB students are doing their internship or looking for a job. Be sure they will be back to carry on the project! Hell yeah! Keep it real!
